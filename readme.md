This is my implementation of Home Assistant, it may not be for the faint of heart - but it is mine and I like it....
Please enjoy my madness and use what you can.
## Introduction
In my setup I rely heavily on YAML and plugins like [lovelace_gen](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-lovelace_gen) and [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card).
I absolutely hate "hard-coding" and will go a great length to make my cards, scripts and automations as flexible as possible.
