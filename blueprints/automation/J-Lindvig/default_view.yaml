    # Default Lovelace view
    This blueprint makes it easy to have a Lovelave interface which returns to a default view after a timeout.
    
    ## Requirements:
    + browser_mod by Thomas Lov√©n (https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod)
    + Home Assistant v. 2021.2.0 as minimum (text selector)
    
    ## Use:
    Find you must find the entity of the device to control. This is sadly not as easy as it could/should be, since Blueprints does not offer the possibility to sort entites by their attribute.
    It gets a little easier if you specify a alias to the deviceID (https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod#aliases)
    
    Second, you must enter the default path.
    
    Lastly you will need to select a timeout in seconds before the device navigates back to the default view.
